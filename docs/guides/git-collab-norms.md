# Git(Hub) Collaboration Norms

The following norms are *highly recommended where possible*. One-off exceptions can of course be made especially if team-members agree. These best-practices can also be edited over time with group consensus. Any updates to this doc should be made via Pull Request so that changes in process expectations are documented.

## 1. Issues

### A. Do use one or more issue label.
> The available labels for this project and their descriptions are available [here](https://github.com/nyu-dh/nyu-dh.github.io/labels).

### B. Do create task lists within issues.

> This can be done by creating a markdown check box list on the issue ticket. (See: [#30](https://github.com/nyu-dh/nyu-dh.github.io/issues/30#issue-1179701978)). E.g., 
``` txt
- [ ] Unchecked list item
- [x] Checked list item
```
> Items can be checked off directly in the GUI after the list is made; you do not need to edit the original comment.

### C. Do assign and reassign issues when possible.

## 2. Branches

### A. Do scope the branch to a specific issue.

### B. Do include the primary issue label and issue number in the branch name.

> The convention should be `label/short-description-issue-number`.  
> E.g., 
>  - ✅ `bug/div-mobile-width-21`
>  - ✅ `content/seed-grant-update-30`
>  - ✅ `feature/news-carousel-15`
>  - ✅ `chore/dev-dependency-upgrade-63`
>  - ❌ `fix-stuff-october`

### C. Do remove branches when changes have been merged into `main`

> Note: this is done automatically if changes are merged via Pull Request.

## 3. Pull Requests

### A. Do reference issue numbers and commit hashes.

### B. Do use closing keywords.

## 4. Project Boards
