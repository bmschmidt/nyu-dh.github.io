# Adding and Editing News Posts

Working doc containing guidelines for newsworthy content.

## Front Matter

All News posts must contain the following front matter:

[ ] title  
[ ] date  
[ ] featureUntil  
[ ] tags  
[ ] abstract  

Optional front matter includes:

[ ] featured  
[ ] image  

### Tips for front matter

- title: 50 characters maximum, preferably ~30 characters.
- date: yyyy-mm-dd format.
- featureUntil: yyyy-mm-dd format. This is the date when the post will be removed from the homepage. It will still be accessible on /news.
- tags: see subsection below.
- abstract: 125 characters is the sweet spot (i.e. target min & max length). This is what appears in the card on the home page and the news page.
- featured: this is probably redundant with featureUntil and can be removed
- image: images not required in the front matter and can probably also be removed.

### Tags

A human readable explanation of the tags in use on the site. Since the tags are used to pull specific news items into specific areas of the site (e.g. put Seed Grants news items on the Seed Grants page), it is important to apply the tags correctly.

seed_grants: Posts pertaining to seed grants, including announcements for CFP, recipients, and showcase; funded projects that have received external funding.    
grad_fellows: For grad fellows, including announcements for CFP, recipients, and showcase.  
courses: About DH courses, including DH certificate core courses and electives.
nycdh: For NYCDH Week events and such.  
external_funding: Funding announcements for projects receiving external funding.  
event: For events. If you're creating an event, also refer to the [events guide](add-edit-events.md)
