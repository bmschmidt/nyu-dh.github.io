# Adding and Editing News & Events Posts

Working doc containing guidelines for newsworthy content.

## Front Matter

All News posts must contain the following front matter:  

[ ] title  
[ ] date  
[ ] tags  
[ ] abstract  

Optional front matter includes:  

[ ] event  
[ ] featureUntil  
[ ] author  

### Tips for front matter

*Required front matter*
- title: 50 characters maximum, preferably ~30 characters.
- date: yyyy-mm-dd format.
- tags: see subsection below.
- abstract: 125 characters is the sweet spot (i.e. target min & max length). This is what appears in the card on the home page and the news page.

*Optional front matter*
- event: if it's an event, set to ```event: true```; don't use if it's just regular ol' news.
- featureUntil: yyyy-mm-dd format. This field is not actually being used, but could be deployed later as a data-driven approach to determine when the post will be removed from the homepage.
- author: this field is not actually used on the site, but why not let us know who you are, eh?

*More tips for front matter*
- title: the passive voice works well here! avoid the active voice - things like "Apply Now..." or "Join us Next Week..." will quickly become outdated and misleading.

*A word on events*  
The main purpose of creating a post for an event on this site is to indicate DH activity that has occurred. Events posts on this site are typically not part of an event's "cycle". We're publishing press releases on events, not events themselves. For example, an event is typically shared on listservs & social media and includes a link to a LibCal or Eventbright registration page.

### Tags

A human readable explanation of the tags in use on the site. Since the tags are used to pull specific news items into specific areas of the site (e.g. put Seed Grants news items on the Seed Grants page), it is important to apply the tags correctly.

seed_grants: Posts pertaining to seed grants, including announcements for CFP, recipients, and showcase; funded projects that have received external funding.    
grad_fellows: For grad fellows, including announcements for CFP, recipients, and showcase.  
courses: About DH courses, including DH certificate core courses and electives.
nycdh: For NYCDH Week events and such.  
external_funding: Funding announcements for projects receiving external funding.
