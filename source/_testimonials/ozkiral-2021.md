The 2021 DH Graduate Student Summer Fellowship afforded me an excellent opportunity to have weekly updates with like-minded peers all involved in a fascinating array of projects. Being able to witness (and both offer and solicit advice!) from these incredibly brilliant individuals and groups in workshops was a fantastic experience, especially as I went on to develop my own DH project that I ended up using to apply to conferences and awards. The funding the fellowship provided allowed me to focus solely on my research that I would not have been able to devote myself to had I needed to work to pay my bills. Furthermore, the funding was also academically useful (as opposed to practically) as I was also able to use it to actually register for a conference that I will present my work at!
