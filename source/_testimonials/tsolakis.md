As a DH Summer Fellow, I had the opportunity to make significant progress in my thesis. Since we were working together with the NYU faculty and the other fellows, I enriched my project in new directions. Furthermore, thanks to the generosity of the fellowship, I was able to support my studies during the challenging period of the pandemic.
