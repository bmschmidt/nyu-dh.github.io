title: Record-Keeping and the Golden Gate
category: Grad Fellowship Project
cohort_year: '2021'
abstract: From the nineteenth century to the present, immigrants encountering the
  mechanisms of American bureaucracy, border control, and immigration restriction
  generate documents that the government collects into individual “Alien Files” (A-Files).
  This project uses Wax, a minimal computing system that utilizes Ruby, Jekyll, OpenSeadragon,
  and iiif, to build a safe and sustainable site that will present research-friendly
  digital collections of A-Files in addition to individual history exhibitions that
  dissect, interpret, and analyze the A-File’s content and evolution.
