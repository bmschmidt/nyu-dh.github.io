  Tsolakis's research question is how, when, and why people in the ancient world were referring to their ancestral past. As part of my project, he was building (and querying) an RDF-based database based on large sets of epigraphic evidence and prosopographical information from printed prosopographies and online databases. Such a database will allow him to answer more complicated questions, as for instance:
  • which are the offices and magistrates attested in a specific polis?
  • which individuals held a specific office in a city;
  • what are the office-holding patterns in the Greek polis;
  • why specific families connect their public presence with specific honorific epithets;
  • what was the role of women in the public sphere and how it was revealed by means of endowments, benefactions, priesthoods, etc.;
  • how name-patterns can help us recognize members of the same family?

  The advantage of an RDF-based database lies in its ability both to store information of various natures and to query multiple SPARQL endpoints based on the needs of the user.
