The Graduate School of Arts and Sciences offers the **[Advanced Certificate in Digital Humanities](https://as.nyu.edu/content/nyu-as/as/departments/dhss/program/advanced-certificate.html)** for students in many programs. The certificate can be taken as a stand-alone, 20-credit, degree; joint degrees are also available that allow students in many GSAS doctoral and masterâ€™s programs to earn the degree with fewer additional credits. Courses are open to all graduate students at NYU, and through the consortium to PhD candidates at other institutions.

Students who wish to explore topics in the digital humanities will find  a large number of courses offered through **[XE](https://as.nyu.edu/departments/xe/about-xe/digital-humanities-initiatives.html)**, [ISAW](https://isaw.nyu.edu/graduate-studies/seminar-descriptions), [English](https://as.nyu.edu/english/graduate/current-graduate-courses-.html), [Public History](https://wp.nyu.edu/archivesandpublichistory/about/courses/), and other departments.

See the [digital humanities courses](/curriculum/courses/) page for a list of courses by semester. If you have questions about which courses qualify as electives in the certificate program, contact the Director of Digital Humanities, Ben Schmidt, at bs145@nyu.edu.

There are also a number of ways to learn Digital Humanities without formally enrolling in coursework. The **[NYU Library offers workshops](https://nyu.libcal.com/)** including Data Services, Digital Scholarship, and High Performance Computing.
