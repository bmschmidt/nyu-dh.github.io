Certificate courses are open to all graduate students at NYU, and through the consortium to PhD candidates at other institutions.

## Fall 2022 Graduate Digital Humanities Courses

### Certificate Courses

DHSS-GA 1121: [Introduction to Programming] (https://benschmidt.org/code21)
Professor: Ben Schmidt
Description: Students will learn the fundamentals of programming in the Python language so that you can automate a variety of common tasks, such as searching through documents, downloading files, or altering/editing texts.

### Electives around the university

CEH-GA 1137 [Digital Humanities: Analysis and Visualization](https://kimon.hosting.nyu.edu/sites/dh-analysis-visualization/) (XE)


## Spring 2023 Graduate Digital Humanities Courses

### Certificate Courses

DHSS-GA 1121: [Working with Data](https://benschmidt.org/WWD22/)
Professor: Ben Schmidt
Description: This graduate seminar develops skills to read and create scholarship in the computationalist traditions of the digital humanities. Students do so through more traditional seminar readings and a series of programming worksets that will teach you how to do a variety of types of data analysis and visualization that are actually useful for humanists and others communicating in areas where the data is messy and culturally contingent, and where the reading audience is not necessarily trained or interested in statistics.

DHSS-GA 1122: Introduction to Web Development
Professor: Zach Coble
Description: This course provides a project-based approach to web programming and development. Students will study the principles of web design and each student will build two distinct websites based on topics relevant to their interests. To complement these practical skills, we will look at how the web has expanded our notions of discourse and explore how websites can be used for scholarly communication. A deeper understanding of these topics will help you make better decisions not only in your own web development practice but also in sharing your work more effectively.

### Electives around the university

CEH-GA 1089 [Digital Humanities: Collections and Connections] (https://kimon.hosting.nyu.edu/sites/dh-collections-connections/) (XE)
Professor: Kimon Keramidas
Description: Two of the most important aspects of digital media are their capacity to allow for the organization of and creation of connections between data. Collecting and connecting technologies have enabled the development of complex information management and network creation systems, which are the foundations of everyday experience in the digital age. This course will consider how databases and networking tools allow us to organize the digital world and how different tools and platforms, such as WordPress, Omeka, Gephi, Twitter, Instagram, and Pinterest, allow us to curate the things in our world and share our experiences. It will also consider how we can analyze these networks and collections to present intellectual arguments in new ways and tell more compelling stories.

CEH-GA 3047 Space, Place and Data (XE)
Professor: Kimon Keramidas
Description: Over the last forty or so years, devices, data, networks, and new modes of visual expression have changed our perception of and ability to express our sense of where we are and how we perceive landscapes of experience. Interdisciplinary fields such as geography and digital humanities have looked to provide new lenses on the worlds around us (both physical and virtual) and new tools with which to share our stories of traveling through different places. These changes reflect our increasing capacity to capture and express geographical information through new tools for doing work in what has come to be called the “spatial humanities.” Immersing ourselves in contemporary geographical thought, including experimentation with new tools and practices, this course will teach students to frame narratives through maps and other spatial visualization tools with a critical understanding that allows them properly situates facts and stories in the digital landscape.
