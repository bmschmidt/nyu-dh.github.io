The Graduate School in Arts and Sciences at NYU offers joint degrees in which a student can receive
an official degree in Digital Humanities while double-counting most of their course work.

Students must take the three [required digital humanities courses](../core-dh-courses), two
of which can be double-counted against their degree requirements, as well as two electives. In most cases,
this means that students will take two additional courses above the requirements for the MA or PhD.

The following programs currently offer a dual degree.

* Comparative Literature PhD
* East Asian Studies PhD
* English MA
* English PhD
* European and Mediterranean Studies MA
* French Studies PhD
* French Studies MA
* Hebrew and Judaic St PhD
* History PhD
* Latin American and Caribbean Studies MA
* Linguistics PhD
* Museum Studies MA
* Music PhD
* Philosophy MA
* Philosophy PhD
* Spanish and Portuguese PhD
