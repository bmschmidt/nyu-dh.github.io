Founded in 1825 by Irish immigrants, this New York bank remains in operation as one of the largest private financial services firms in the city, Brown Brothers Harriman. An initial phase of collection’s digitization was recently completed with support from a Hidden Archives grant. We anticipate many kinds of stories that might be told from this collection, ranging from the history of global finance capital and the New York banking sector to New York City’s financial and administrative role in the slave economy. This pilot seeks to create a dataset and machine-readable transcriptions encompassing the contents of the original records, and to develop potential uses of the data by scholars, teachers, and the general public as an open-access resource.","Tom Augst and Nick Wolf’s work clearly shows

It focuses on artificial intelligence (AI) and hiring. Thanks to AI, hiring is undergoing a quiet, yet earth-shaking revolution. Many Fortune 500 companies employ AI-based solutions to weed through the millions of job applications the companies receive every year. The problem\: many companies don\'t want to reveal what technology they are using and vendors don\'t want to reveal what\'s in the black box, despite evidence that some automated decision making systems make biased and/or arbitrary decisions. This project combines methods of investigative journalism, sociology, and data science to develop a new socio-technical tool for critically investigating and auditing AI systems used in hiring.","Using FOIA this team will soon try

FALSE,slave-insurance,Insuring Slavery: Underwriting Risk in the 18th Century,DH Seed Grant Recipient,2020,Documenting the growth of the insurance industry in the slave trade,"“Underwriting Risk in the 18th century” provides the first systematic analysis of the application of probabilistic mathematics to the trade in enslaved Africans during the designated period. It will provide foundational research for an exploration of the relationship between the marine insurance industry and the trans-Atlantic trade in human beings across more than one hundred years. This research is comprised of three activities that will produce two outcomes. The first activity involves systematically consulting the remaining records of every known Lloyd’s of London-affiliated underwriter in order to ascertain the extant information on the insurance of slave voyages through London’s largest insurance market. The second activity entails a reevaluation of insurance-focused archival collections for records pertaining to the trade of enslaved Africans as well as a reevaluation of slavery-focused archival collections for records pertaining to insurance. The third activity we intend to engage in is preliminary archival research on the relationship between the slave trade and insurance in Spain, Holland, and Switzerland as well as the insurance of slave-produced goods returning to Europe. The first result of our funded activities will be the foundational research that I use to comprehensively analyze how monetary value was produced and inscribed during the trans-Atlantic slave trade. The second result of our funded activities will be a vastly expanded data set to include in the digital ledger I founded and direct, Treasury of Weary Souls, which currently provides interactive, public access to all known insurance policies that underwrote enslaved persons as property on the plantations of the antebellum American South.","This project, our first love, that powered

Intersecting the history of science, critical archival studies, and recent interventions into decolonizing design, this digital humanities project uses a specific set of sources (ranging from archival and manuscript materials to herbarium specimens) to ask how women, indigenous experts, and working-class collectors’ contributions to the history of botany have been subsumed and silenced in the service of natural historical “authorship”--in this case, by the British bryologist William Mitten (1819-1906). By engaging a multitude of stakeholders across various fields and levels of expertise, this public-facing project explores how reading moss from multiple perspectives can engender new systems of knowledge production crossing colonial natural history, museum and archival studies, and decolonial design practices.","The topic's not obviously boss;

Cuba Material has been a multi-year effort at the community and academic level to preserve and make available to scholars and other interested parties information regarding the common goods, fabrics, objects and uniforms, among other material objects, that circulated in Cuba following the 1959 Revolution. Both the objects and meanings (social, political, aesthetic) will be preserved in digital form for documentation and study. The innovative web platform will catalogue objects, male them easily searchable, host digital exhibitions, and provide mechanisms for additional contributions from the community, contextualization, and discussion.

ZineCat lets researchers discover zine holdings by searching a single catalog, helps librarians copy catalog records to eliminate duplication of cataloging effort, and facilitates lending across libraries. ZineCat serves educators, researchers, librarians, archivists, and anyone in the general public with an interest in zines. Zines – self-published literature that often features counter cultural, political, and artistic content – are an increasingly important primary resource for humanities, social sciences, and other scholars, but due to the diverse standards and practices among the libraries, archives, and community organizations that collect and maintain them, accessing them through traditional research discovery systems is difficult. The initial prototype was developed by Lauren Kehoe (Faculty Librarian, NYU) and Jenna Freedman (Librarian, Barnard) in their MA Digital Humanities program at the City University of New York Graduate Center using 25 records from three libraries with different metadata schema: MARC, Dublin Core, and a spreadsheet-based standalone schema to a Collective Access catalog.

What will become of these various collecting efforts, and how will scholars be able to locate them effectively? The COVID Collections Project aims to catalogue the many COVID-19 oral history, documentation, and archiving projects that have begun since winter 2020. As a multi-year project, we have started to survey repositories and oral historians to discover and catalogue the collections that are being built around the global experience of COVID-19.
