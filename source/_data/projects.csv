It will provide foundational research for an exploration of the relationship between the marine insurance industry and the trans-Atlantic trade in human beings across more than one hundred years. This research is comprised of three activities that will produce two outcomes. The first activity involves systematically consulting the remaining records of every known Lloyd’s of London-affiliated underwriter in order to ascertain the extant information on the insurance of slave voyages through London’s largest insurance market. The second activity entails a reevaluation of insurance-focused archival collections for records pertaining to the trade of enslaved Africans as well as a reevaluation of slavery-focused archival collections for records pertaining to insurance. The third activity we intend to engage in is preliminary archival research on the relationship between the slave trade and insurance in Spain, Holland, and Switzerland as well as the insurance of slave-produced goods returning to Europe. The first result of our funded activities will be the foundational research that I use to comprehensively analyze how monetary value was produced and inscribed during the trans-Atlantic slave trade.

This project will not only shed new light on medieval Sufi history but also contribute to efforts already underway to digitize Islamic texts by introducing a previously neglected body of literature.",,musto,,,
FALSE,g2022hatanaka,"""Why Are There No ACS Offices in SoHO?"": and Interactive, Digital Map of Family Surveillance in New York City",Grad Fellowship Project,2022,,"This research project stems from provocations by abolitionist organizers in New York City, with questions such as, “Why are there no ACS offices in SoHo?” For the summer of 2022, I aim to create an interactive, digital map that layers three key data sets for visualization: 1) the number of child welfare investigations that take place in New York City by neighborhood, 2) the location of Administration for Children’s Services (ACS) offices, and 3) the locations of the top New York City schools that make reports to the Office of Children and Family Services. The overarching research question for this digital mapping project is: what does understanding space relationally reveal about surveillance tools and practices in family policing? Asking such a question is rooted in the methodologies of Black Feminist Geographies. Following Simone Browne’s work regarding surveillance technologies, I’d like to understand the spatial relationship between schools, child welfare offices, and the space of the home through the home visits caseworkers conduct. My intention is this project will inform aspects of my dissertation. As a scholar engaged with communities organizing to make changes in how the state interacts with families, especially poor Black and Brown families, my intention is not only for this digital map to serve an intellectual purpose of answering research questions, but for this map to hopefully lead to change in how family policing is understood in New York City.",,hatanaka,,,
FALSE,errant-americas,Arts of the Errant Americas,DH Seed Grant Recipient,2022,,"“Arts of the Errant Americas” proposes a pilot program for a series of annual digital humanities art exhibitions that aim to reroute the standard narrative of “American art” by emphasizing unvoiced or silenced stories. Hosted by the Institute of Fine Arts (IFA), NYU, the program provides a broad remit for student curators to mount online exhibitions across chronology and media that reconsider the standard classification of American art typically confined to tight sociopolitical boundaries, such as stable notions of nationality, class, and race. By organizing exhibitions concentrating on underrepresented communities, this project foregrounds diversity, equity, and inclusion. With the funds from the seed grant, we will build an expandable website to host the annual exhibitions, secure digitization tools for future use, and curate a prototype exhibition to inaugurate the website and demonstrate the wide offerings of the digital world for art humanities. This exhibition will center on Chicana artist Yreina Cervántez’s recently restored mural La Ofrenda (1989). Cervántez was selected as the first artist in this series due to her institutional neglect despite her significant impact on the Central American community in Los Angeles. This exhibition is a platform for increased appreciation of her contribution to Latinx arts and a prompt to develop compelling solutions to translate her murals into the digital.",,sloane-britt,,,
FALSE,nlines,nLines and Changing: Writing the Shanghai Metro System to the End,DH Seed Grant Recipient,2022,,"n Lines and Changing is an ongoing digital poetry project that arises from nearly 15 years of living in Shanghai, and which I use the expanding Shanghai Metro system as a composional tool which both guides explorations of the city and which shapes the composion of a digital poem. I use chance procedures to determine destinations within Shanghai's sprawling Metro system (currently 506 staons, with more opening soon, and 19 active lines, with more planned). I then do an ""algorithmic walk"" determined by chance procedures. The goal is to ""write the city"" in line with its constant, dynamic, ongoing change. I do not intend to ""finish"" in the conventional sense, but keep it ""open"" as I take new trips, and as new lines and stations are added, and as collaborators join (including, eventually, via a public app). I would use this grant to take it from its current proof-of-concept stage and to launch it publicly, both online and in talks, readings and lectures. The grant would allow me to develop and expand the site (adding documentation, photography, video and sound recordings, a Chinese translation ""toggle,"" and a critical essay).",,perry,,,
FALSE,sight-site-cite,Sight/Site/Cite in the Digital Middle East,DH Seed Grant Recipient,2022,,"Sight/Site/Cite (S/S/C) seeks to create a digital hub dedicated to examining changing practices of Middle East digital scholarship which will gather, curate, and publish multimedia chronicles about the methods undergirding such projects. The aim is to engender and amplify scholarly exchange around changing digital practices and methods for humanistic research on, in, and of the larger Middle East. Our application is for the development and creation of the initial infrastructure of S/S/C. In the first year, six solicited pieces will serve as methods and practice-based chronicles detailing multi-modal and multi-media approaches to digital scholarship on, in, and of the region from a diverse set of academics. During the initial year we will build the S/S/C hub and plan its future expansion, establish an advisory board, host a roundtable at the 2022 Middle East Studies Association conference, establish a long-term partnership with the Kevorkian Center and its fledgling Digital Middle East Lab, and seek other potential partners and funding.",,mccormick,,,
FALSE,chem-hum,Digitizing Chemical Humanities: Toward a Cross-cultural History of Chemistry,DH Seed Grant Recipient,2022,,"The vast majority of non-European alchemy sources remains, for a variety of reasons, untranslated. I address the strategic question of where to start the slow, labor intensive process of translating vast multilingual corpora from the Middle East, India and China. My short-term focus is to use natural language processing (NLP) methods of unsupervised metaphor detection to triage untranslated alchemical texts and sort them for different research needs. I propose to identify key metaphoric phrases drawn from well-known English alchemical text as a basis for our NLP discrimination model. Recent advances in unsupervised metaphor detection, based on the ubiquity of metaphor in all languages may anchor NLP detection of naturally occuring meaningful clusters in virtually any language. My overarching goal is to demonstrate the potential of digital humanities tools in combination with computational chemistry resources, such as the Reaxys CC database, with data on 200 million chemical substances and about 60 million chemical reactions from 1750 to 2015. My colleague, Prof. Restrepo at the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in Science, and the History of Science, has licensed access through MPI to Reaxys and has agreed to collaborate on extending his analysis of chemical knowledge production to pre-1750 periods.",,mahootian,,,

Working at the intersection of Museum Studies and Computer Science, Historic Fractures: Toward A Digital Future in Museum Accessibility leverages inclusive design practices and digital technology to make historic house museums accessible. Faculty members from Museum Studies and Computer Science conduct original field research at Villa La Pietra with students to lead content and development for the creation of three digital modules designed for a range of visitors with disabilities: 1) an augmented reality platform that integrates historical and archival photography to create a guided tour for visitors that are deaf or have low levels of hearing 2) a relational database of signatures that trace connected histories of early 20th c. visitors 3) implementation of a selected museum object from Villa La Pietra’s collection for visitors that are blind or have low vision. By training the next generation of computer scientists and museum scholars as highly-informed advocates for audiences with diverse motor, cognitive, sensory, and behavior-emotional disabilities, this project supports tactical and strategic skills to develop multi-sensory content in historic houses.",,flouty,,,
