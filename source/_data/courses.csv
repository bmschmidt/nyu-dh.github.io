Collecting and connecting technologies have enabled the development of complex information management and network creation systems, which are the foundations of everyday experience in the digital age. Because these systems play such a significant role in how we communicate with one another they are critical to understanding how new media can play a role in public discourse and scholarly conversations. This course will consider how databases and networking tools allow us to organize the digital world and how different tools and platforms, such as WordPress, Omeka, Gephi, Twitter, Instagram, and Pinterest, allow us to curate the things in our world and share our experiences. It will also consider how we can analyze these networks and collections to present intellectual arguments in new ways and tell more compelling stories. Along with practical work with digital tools, this course will include readings on network culture and digital curation by authors such as McLuhan, Gitelman, Castells, Shirky, Manovich, Cohen, Ramsay, and Galloway.",https://kimon.hosting.nyu.edu/sites/dh-collections-connections/
FALSE,1121-sp22,DHSS-GA.1121,Working with Data,Spring 2022,DHSS,Ben Schmidt,Monday,6:20-9:20 pm,"Data analysis in the humanities presents challenges of scale, interpretation, and communication distinct from the social sciences and sciences. In recent years, a number of new practices in this sphere have begun to cohere: “cultural analytics,” “distant reading,” “macroanalysis,” and “data feminism.” But it can be hard for humanists to learn how to apply these practices, not just talk intelligently about them.

This graduate seminar will develop skills to read and create scholarship in these computationalist traditions of the digital humanities. We’ll do so through more traditional seminar readings and a series of programming worksets that will teach you how to do a variety of types of data analysis and visualization that are actually useful for humanists and others communicating in areas where the data is messy and culturally contingent, and where the reading audience is not necessarily trained or interested in statistics.",https://benschmidt.org/WWD22

The data portion of the class will begin with an understanding of the ontologies of data and metadata and address analysis techniques such as distant reading, topic modeling, text encoding, and text analysis. The visualization portion of the class will interrogate just what it means to visualize an argument and will include both a critique of and experimentation with timelines, maps, infographics, charts, and visual confections that are used as alternatives to textual explanation. We will work with digital tools for analyzing and visualizing humanities data, such as AbbyFine, Voyant, Topic Modeling Tool, ArcGIS, and Agisoft Metashape.",

Students will study the principles of web design and each student will build two distinct websites based on topics relevant to their interests. To complement these practical skills, we will look at how the web has expanded our notions of discourse and explore how websites can be used for scholarly communication. A deeper understanding of these topics will help you make better decisions not only in your own web development practice but also in sharing your work more effectively.",

,,CEH-GA 3032,Citizenship in the Digital Age,Fall 2022,XE,Kimon Keramidas,Tuesday,6:15-9:00pm,"Data-driven campaigns, inaccurate polling, hacked email systems, social media disinformation, hyper-polarized media coverage, debates over electoral tabulation, the evidence is all around us that the digital technologies of the 21st century have become central features of global political discourse and processes. This course considers how these new technologies have altered our approach to acquiring and critiquing data and information, mediated our modes of social communication, and in turn, fundamentally changed the experience of being a citizen. The course includes discussions of foundational readings on theories of citizenship and the development of large-scale networked information systems. Additional topics include methods of the role of digital tools and algorithms in shaping polling methodology, demographic segmentation through digitally-enhanced mapmaking (see gerrymandering), representations of race, gender, and ethnicity in the digital public sphere, and online protest and activism. To support readings and in-class discussions, students will perform real-time critical analysis through a close integration of the upcoming 2022 mid-term elections into coursework. Each student will select a significant political race to follow and report back to the class about how the history, theories, and current events we will be studying relate to the day-to-day progress coming out of their race.",https://kimon.hosting.nyu.edu/sites/citizenship-in-the-digital-age/
,,CEH-GA 3047,"Space, Place, and Data: Spatial Humanities and the Crafting of Digital Narratives",Fall 2022,XE,Kimon Keramidas,Wednesday,2:00-5:00pm,"As the digital medium has exploded over the last forty or so years, devices, data, networks, and new modes of visual expression have changed our perception of and ability to express our sense of where we are and how we perceive landscapes of experience. As a result, notions of space and place, and a desire to express the situatedness of lived experience and historical narratives, have come increasingly to the fore in humanities and the social sciences. At the same time, interdisciplinary fields such as geography and digital humanities have looked to provide new lenses on the worlds around us (both physical and virtual) and new tools with which to share our stories of traveling through different places. These changes reflect our increasing capacity to capture and express geographical information through new tools for doing work in what has come to be called the “spatial humanities.” This course will explore our new perceptions of space and place relative to data and data structures both creatively and critically, including questioning how the epistemological tendencies of specific tools--and geographic information systems (GIS) as a whole--impact our perception of the world. Along with readings and discussion, an important part of this course will be learning about the kinds of tools that can be used to perform work in the spatial humanities and their relative strengths and weaknesses, including Google Maps/Earth, StoryMap JS, Tableau, ArcGIS, ESRI StoryMaps and ARIS.",https://kimon.hosting.nyu.edu/sites/space-place-data/
