cc21,Collections and Connections,Fall 2021,XE,keramidas,"Tuesday, 2:00-5:00","Two of the most important aspects of digital media are their capacity to allow for the organization of and creation of connections between data. Collecting and connecting technologies have enabled the development of complex information management and network creation systems, which are the foundations of everyday experience in the digital age. Because these systems play such a significant role in how we communicate with one another they are critical to understanding how new media can play a role in public discourse and scholarly conversations. This course will consider how databases and networking tools allow us to organize the digital world and how different tools and platforms, such as WordPress, Omeka, Gephi, Twitter, Instagram, and Pinterest, allow us to curate the things in our world and share our experiences. It will also consider how we can analyze these networks and collections to present intellectual arguments in new ways and tell more compelling stories. Along with practical work with digital tools, this course will include readings on network culture and digital curation by authors such as McLuhan, Gitelman, Castells, Shirky, Manovich, Cohen, Ramsay, and Galloway.",https://kimon.hosting.nyu.edu/sites/dh-collections-connections/
data22,Working with Data,Spring 2022,DHSS,schmidt,"Mon, 6:20-9:20","Data analysis in the humanities presents challenges of scale, interpretation, and communication distinct from the social sciences and sciences. In recent years, a number of new practices in this sphere have begun to cohere: “cultural analytics,” “distant reading,” “macroanalysis,” and “data feminism.” But it can be hard for humanists to learn how to apply these practices, not just talk intelligently about them. This graduate seminar will develop skills to read and create scholarship in these computationalist traditions of the digital humanities. We’ll do so through more traditional seminar readings and a series of programming worksets that will teach you how to do a variety of types of data analysis and visualization that are actually useful for humanists and others communicating in areas where the data is messy and culturally contingent, and where the reading audience is not necessarily trained or interested in statistics.",benschmidt.org/WWD22
