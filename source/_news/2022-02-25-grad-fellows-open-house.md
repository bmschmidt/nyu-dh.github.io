# Event: DH Graduate Student Summer Fellowship Open House

Join us to learn more about the DH Graduate Student Summer Fellowship program.

We welcome any questions about your project proposals and/or the summer program.
Join us from 12:30 - 1:30pm EST on Zoom at https://nyu.zoom.us/j/91305654842.

# The Fellowships
The Center for the Humanities, in partnership with the NYU Libraries and NYU Research Technology, invites applications for 2022 Digital Humanities Graduate Student Summer Fellowships. Students apply with their own proposed project, which might involve–for example–engaging with digital humanities methods as the basis for a dissertation chapter or article, or building a digital public humanities project or exhibit. Project work will take place during Summer 2022, and participants will report on work completed at a Fall 2022 event.

The deadline for summer fellowships is March 6, 2022. You can also direct any questions to dh.help@nyu.edu.
