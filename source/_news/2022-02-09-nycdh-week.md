# Event: Seed to Scale: Leveraging Institutional Grants for Additional Funding

This roundtable session features projects that have leveraged NYU DH Seed Grants to scale up and receive additional funding from external sources. Given the NYCDH theme of Support, panelists will share their processes and highlight elements of their work that made a difference in their ability to grow their projects and attract new funding. Participants will include:

Elaine Ayers, “”Inverting the Wunderkammer: Rethinking the Digital Humanities through Botanic Histories and Archives,”” $50,000 Digital Humanities Advancement Grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities

Hilke Schellmann and Mona Sloane, “Transparency For All – Bringing public records expertise, advanced AI, and editorial support to under-resourced newsrooms across America”, $200,000 from Patrick J. McGovern Foundation, to collaborate with MuckRock.

Since 2019, NYU Center for the Humanities, NYU Research Technologies, and NYU Libraries have jointly sponsored a DH Seed Grant program, which aims to seed projects that may go on to receive greater funding from other sources or otherwise build NYU’s institutional capacity in Digital Humanities work. Projects that give voice or expression to underrepresented communities; that engage with the urban fabric of the cities in which NYU has campuses; and that contribute to the subfield of Global Digital Humanities are especially welcomed.
