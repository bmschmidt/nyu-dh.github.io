  The multi-year seed grants program identifies and funds faculty-led projects that creatively bridge humanistic scholarship with new forms of computation, digital publishing, and digitization.

The Center for the Humanities, NYU Libraries, and NYU Research Technology fund the initial development of new research projects that will analyze digital sources, apply algorithmic methods to humanities data, or create digital publications, exhibits, or websites. The goal of the program is to seed projects that may go on to receive greater funding from other sources or otherwise build NYU’s institutional capacity in Digital Humanities work. 

## Seed Grant News
Port posts in? I'm not sure how necessary it is to have these cards here. It starts to get crowded if the news shows up everywhere it's relevant. Maybe it's just about a shortened list of headlines?

## More about the Seed Grants
* I feel like the following copy could move to FAQs
Grants may range in size between $5,000 and $20,000. Collaborative projects are encouraged, but must include at least one NYU faculty member in the humanities. Additional resources may be made available for those proposing computationally intensive work utilizing NYU’s high performance computing cluster and similar [Research Technology resources](https://www.nyu.edu/research/navigating-research-technology.html). We especially welcome projects that give voice or expression to underrepresented communities; that engage with the urban fabric of the cities in which NYU has campuses; and that contribute to the emerging subfield of Global Digital Humanities.

## Past projects 
* I think this section would ideally be a condensed list that leads to a filtered set of projects based on grant year.
#### 2021 - 2022 
#### 2020 – 2021 
#### 2019 - 2020

## Grant Cycle 
* I feel like this might be nice as a gray content block so that it sits apart from the above information. I could also imagine a calendar or gantt for the timeline overview.

December: CFP Circulated.

early March: Applications due.

March: Review panel meets for evaluation period.
