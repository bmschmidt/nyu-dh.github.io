## Questions about Eligibility
### Can a Visiting Full-Time Assistant Professor apply?
Yes.
### Can a grad student apply?
For larger projects that involve faculty, students can apply as the principle investigator, but in general we encourage students to apply for the Graduate Student Fellowships.
### Are the Digital Humanities Seed Grant open to applications from NYU Shanghai faculty? 
Yes, the applications are open to all global campus applications.
### Do I have to be in the Humanities to apply for a DH Seed Grant?
As long as the project demonstrates digital humanities engagement and methods, the opportunity is open to scholars in any department.

## Questions about Applications

## Budget Questions
### Do you have a sample budget?

### How do you hire a student?
For many departments, NYU facilitates student hiring with the Handshake web application. If your department doesn't have its own Handshake account, ask your department administrator about best practices.
### How much do I need to budget for a student worker?
For the grad student worker, assuming that it will be an NYU student, you must include an additional 30% for overhead (health insurance, etc). For example, if you have a student working 10 hours at $20/hour, you'd put down $260 ($200 in wages + $60 in overhead).

### How do you hire an outside worker?
Hiring outside of NYU is different from department to department. In some cases, you need to go to your department Human Resources. There may be additional requirements to go through paperwork to hire contractors or vendors. If you know you will be looking to hire someone specific, we encourage you to speak with your department when you create your budget.

Terms of work?
Contract guidelines for vendors


### Will funded projects have access to NYU's technologies, software copyrights, and, more in general, received technological assistance, or should the budget include the purchase of all of the aforementioned items?

This program is eager to fund projects that expand the use of various services provided by NYU's research technology. In many cases outside collaborators working with NYU teams are able to to create--for example--accounts within the NYU HPC cluster with cost. Experts from NYU libraries and from NYU research technology are made available for consultation, but programs needing software developers must budget for them. 

### Are there things I canâ€™t pay for with the DH Seed Grant funding?
