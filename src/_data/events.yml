    This workshop will introduce how academics present themselves and their work online. We will examine how academic platforms, social media, and personal websites can build your public humanities profile. Building on this, we will help participants set up manageable steps for getting started and moving forward.
    <br><br>
    This part of a three-part workshop series that will help you develop the digital skills needed to support your Public Humanities work. The workshops will help you cultivate your online presence as well as identifying strategies for engaging with audiences and communities relevant to your work. Each workshop will have two parts—a one-hour group session to introduce topics and tools, followed later in the week by a drop-in session to set up practical steps for moving forward. Students may sign up for just one or two workshops, although we hope you'll be able to join us for all three!

        Approaching your online academic presence from a different angle, this workshop will look at the public your humanities scholarship engages. By identifying the larger ecosystem of audiences and user communities, we will then examine strategies for meeting and engaging your constituents where they are.
