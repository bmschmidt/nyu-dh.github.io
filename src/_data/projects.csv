pr0,Brown Brothers Collection,DH Seed Grant Recipient,2020,Uncovering the historical data linking New York bankers to slavery,"The Brown Brothers Collection is a collaborative, cross-institutional research project that will develop robust teaching, research, and public humanities resources that leverage the digitized Brown Brothers & Company archives held by the New York Public Library. Founded in 1825 by Irish immigrants, this New York bank remains in operation as one of the largest private financial services firms in the city, Brown Brothers Harriman. An initial phase of collection’s digitization was recently completed with support from a Hidden Archives grant. We anticipate many kinds of stories that might be told from this collection, ranging from the history of global finance capital and the New York banking sector to New York City’s financial and administrative role in the slave economy. This pilot seeks to create a dataset and machine-readable transcriptions encompassing the contents of the original records, and to develop potential uses of the data by scholars, teachers, and the general public as an open-access resource.",augst; wolf,https://newyorkscapes.org/brownbrothers/,https://newyorkscapes.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/018.57733030.117d9410-dc97-0136-03f0-000d5d842228-edited-768x768.jpeg
pr1,Developing a 'Publications Page' for NYU’s Prison Education Program (PEP) Website,DH Seed Grant Recipient,2020,Publishing research from incarcerated people.,"This project will establish a website that showcases the finest writing generated by students enrolled in NYU’s Prison Education Project. Unlike many websites that publish diaristic writing from the incarcerated, this website focuses on displaying students’ abilities as critical and creative thinkers fully capable of engaging in rigorous academic and scholarly work. The aim is to provide a wider forum for these students’ work and to illustrate the intellectual integrity of incarcerated students’ academic potential in ways that are not reflected in the existing publishing platforms. By highlighting their ability to see connections across disparate texts, to situate their experiences within the context of a broader intellectual history, and to use theoretical texts as prisms to deepen and expand the meaning and significance of a range of evidence, this project hopes to contribute to the reshaping of perceptions and understanding of the incarcerated.",jacobs,https://prisoneducation.nyu.edu,https://prisoneducation.nyu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/DSC_0418-1-250x250.jpg
pr2,Holding Hiring Algorithms Accountable and Creating New Tools for Humanistic Research,DH Seed Grant Recipient,2020,Revealing the reality of hiring patterns through AI,"The ""Holding Hiring Algorithms Accountable and Creating New Tools for Humanistic Research"" project is led by Prof. Hilke Schellmann (Journalism) and Dr. Mona Sloane (Tandon). It focuses on artificial intelligence (AI) and hiring. Thanks to AI, hiring is undergoing a quiet, yet earth-shaking revolution. Many Fortune 500 companies employ AI-based solutions to weed through the millions of job applications the companies receive every year. The problem\: many companies don\'t want to reveal what technology they are using and vendors don\'t want to reveal what\'s in the black box, despite evidence that some automated decision making systems make biased and/or arbitrary decisions. This project combines methods of investigative journalism, sociology, and data science to develop a new socio-technical tool for critically investigating and auditing AI systems used in hiring.",schellmann; sloane,,
pr3,Insuring Slavery: Underwriting Risk in the 18th Century,DH Seed Grant Recipient,2020,Documenting the growth of the insurance industry in the slave trade,"“Underwriting Risk in the 18th century” provides the first systematic analysis of the application of probabilistic mathematics to the trade in enslaved Africans during the designated period. It will provide foundational research for an exploration of the relationship between the marine insurance industry and the trans-Atlantic trade in human beings across more than one hundred years. This research is comprised of three activities that will produce two outcomes. The first activity involves systematically consulting the remaining records of every known Lloyd’s of London-affiliated underwriter in order to ascertain the extant information on the insurance of slave voyages through London’s largest insurance market. The second activity entails a reevaluation of insurance-focused archival collections for records pertaining to the trade of enslaved Africans as well as a reevaluation of slavery-focused archival collections for records pertaining to insurance. The third activity we intend to engage in is preliminary archival research on the relationship between the slave trade and insurance in Spain, Holland, and Switzerland as well as the insurance of slave-produced goods returning to Europe. The first result of our funded activities will be the foundational research that I use to comprehensively analyze how monetary value was produced and inscribed during the trans-Atlantic slave trade. The second result of our funded activities will be a vastly expanded data set to include in the digital ledger I founded and direct, Treasury of Weary Souls, which currently provides interactive, public access to all known insurance policies that underwrote enslaved persons as property on the plantations of the antebellum American South.",ralph,,media/project-images/slave_insurance_sm.png
pr4,Raising the Volume: Amplifying Soul of Reason,DH Seed Grant Recipient,2020,Recovering hours of vital radio conversations with Black and Latino cultural leaders,"Raising the Volume is a cross-departmental initiative to transform a historically and culturally rich radio program on Black and Latino culture into a collaboratively curated collection as data. The NYU Division of Libraries and the NYU Institute of African American Affairs collaborated on a series of events in inviting community members to correct auto-generated transcripts of digital audio files of the radio program. In the second half of the project, we plan to collaboratively create and curate a dataset consisting of these transcriptions and Wikidata items and to support a graduate student project in the digital humanities.",bunde,https://nyu-dss.github.io/soul-of-reason/,https://nyu-dss.github.io/soul-of-reason/images/uploads/roscoe-brown-IAAA.jpg
pr5,The South African Jewish Cookbook Project,DH Seed Grant Recipient,2020,Documenting apartheid communities through their home life,"The South African Jewish Cookbook Project will digitize a corpus of 50 community cookbooks, created by South African Jewish women during the apartheid era. It will unite the cookbooks, collected from a broad range of institutions and private individuals spread across the globe, into a single digital collection. The project will present the cookbooks on a curated website, where users will be able to search, browse, and interact with the books, and read a series of interlinked encyclopedia-style articles exploring the wider significance of the cookbook corpus for South African and Jewish culture, history, and culinary practice. The project will be of particular value to members of the South African Jewish diaspora, particularly those interested in culinary heritage, communal history, and genealogical research, as well as for scholars working on topics relating to South Africa, food, Judaism, race, gender, and the postwar period. It will actively engage the public, encouraging users to contribute cookbooks and share written and video memories relating to the cookbooks and to South African Jewish food culture.",beinart-smollan,,

pr7,Inverting the Wunderkammer: Rethinking the Digital Humanities through Botanic Histories and Archives,DH Seed Grant Recipient,2021,,"Focusing on the the nineteenth-century bryological Mitten Collection at the New York Botanical Garden, this project uses moss--one of the most commonplace and adaptive plants in the world--to explore how experimental digital imaging techniques and pluralistic storytelling might be applied to colonial botanical collections to open up ways to critically interrogate violent systems of classification and order. Intersecting the history of science, critical archival studies, and recent interventions into decolonizing design, this digital humanities project uses a specific set of sources (ranging from archival and manuscript materials to herbarium specimens) to ask how women, indigenous experts, and working-class collectors’ contributions to the history of botany have been subsumed and silenced in the service of natural historical “authorship”--in this case, by the British bryologist William Mitten (1819-1906). By engaging a multitude of stakeholders across various fields and levels of expertise, this public-facing project explores how reading moss from multiple perspectives can engender new systems of knowledge production crossing colonial natural history, museum and archival studies, and decolonial design practices.",ansari; ayres; brain,,
pr8,Archive of Cuban Socialism (ARCHCUS),DH Seed Grant Recipient,2021,,"The proposed Archive of Cuban Socialism (ARCHCUS) will document and archive the material culture of everyday life in Cuba between 1959 and 1990. It builds on an existing blog, Cuba Material, which will be expanded into a comprehensive, interactive, systematic, and user-friendly platform. Cuba Material has been a multi-year effort at the community and academic level to preserve and make available to scholars and other interested parties information regarding the common goods, fabrics, objects and uniforms, among other material objects, that circulated in Cuba following the 1959 Revolution. Both the objects and meanings (social, political, aesthetic) will be preserved in digital form for documentation and study. The innovative web platform will catalogue objects, male them easily searchable, host digital exhibitions, and provide mechanisms for additional contributions from the community, contextualization, and discussion. This makes it a significant contribution to the study of contemporary material culture as well as to Cuban, Caribbean, Latin American, and state socialist studies. ",cabrera-arus,,
pr9,The Zine Union Catalog (ZineCat),DH Seed Grant Recipient,2021,,"The Zine Union Catalog (aka ZineCat) is a union catalog dedicated to zines. A union catalog is a resource where libraries can share cataloging and holdings information. ZineCat lets researchers discover zine holdings by searching a single catalog, helps librarians copy catalog records to eliminate duplication of cataloging effort, and facilitates lending across libraries. ZineCat serves educators, researchers, librarians, archivists, and anyone in the general public with an interest in zines. Zines – self-published literature that often features counter cultural, political, and artistic content – are an increasingly important primary resource for humanities, social sciences, and other scholars, but due to the diverse standards and practices among the libraries, archives, and community organizations that collect and maintain them, accessing them through traditional research discovery systems is difficult. The initial prototype was developed by Lauren Kehoe (Faculty Librarian, NYU) and Jenna Freedman (Librarian, Barnard) in their MA Digital Humanities program at the City University of New York Graduate Center using 25 records from three libraries with different metadata schema: MARC, Dublin Core, and a spreadsheet-based standalone schema to a Collective Access catalog. The prototype has grown to include over 31,000 zines from six collections.",kehoe,https://zinecat.org/,media/project-images/zinecat.png
pr10,COVID Collections,DH Seed Grant Recipient,2021,,"As COVID-19 began to dominate the global agenda during the spring of 2020, museums, libraries, and archives around the world announced efforts to document human experiences of illness, isolation, economic downturn, fear, adaptation, and solidarity. These efforts ranged widely in scale and methods, from local historical societies seeking personal reflections to large scale federally-funded oral history projects. What will become of these various collecting efforts, and how will scholars be able to locate them effectively? The COVID Collections Project aims to catalogue the many COVID-19 oral history, documentation, and archiving projects that have begun since winter 2020. As a multi-year project, we have started to survey repositories and oral historians to discover and catalogue the collections that are being built around the global experience of COVID-19. We will then develop a website that will help researchers find these collections. We also hope to foster collaborations among archivists, documentarists, and historians as the collections are being developed. The COVID Collections Project is a collaboration among the Initiative for Critical Disaster Studies (NYU Gallatin), the Archives and Public History Program (NYU GSAS), and the E.L. Quarantelli Resource Collection at the University of Delaware’s Disaster Research Center. ",noonan,https://wp.nyu.edu/disasters/covid-collections-project/,

The College of Dentistry is creating such a museum by 3D scanning and digitizing its artifacts using the services of the LaGuardia Studio for high resolution scanning and a novel 3D display software called Sketchfab, to manipulate objects in space. The current effort is one of the very few in the World to utilize such technology for museum artifacts.",spielman,,
