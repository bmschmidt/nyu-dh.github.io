  The multi-year seed grants program identifies and funds faculty-led projects that creatively bridge humanistic scholarship with new forms of computation, digital publishing, and digitization.

Digital humanities scholarship takes a variety of forms, from algorithmic analysis to public scholarship; there are no restrictions in form or subject area that can be funded under this program. Additional resources may be made available for those proposing computationally intensive work utilizing NYU’s high performance computing cluster and similar [Research Technology resources](https://www.nyu.edu/research/navigating-research-technology.html). We especially welcome projects that give voice or expression to underrepresented communities; that engage with the urban fabric of the cities in which NYU has campuses; and that contribute to the emerging subfield of Global Digital Humanities.
