NYU currently offers one degree in Digital Humanities, the **[Advanced Certificate in Digital Humanities program](https://as.nyu.edu/content/nyu-as/as/departments/dhss/program/advanced-certificate.html)**, which is open through application to students in many PhD and Masterâ€™s programs in Arts and Sciences. Courses are open to all students at NYU, and through the consortium to PhD candidates at other institutions. Students who wish to explore topics in the digital humanities will find  a large number of courses offered through **[XE](https://as.nyu.edu/departments/xe/about-xe/digital-humanities-initiatives.html)**, the program in experimental humanities; **[Integrated Design and Media (IDM)](http://idm.engineering.nyu.edu/)** and **[Interactive Telecommunications Program (ITP)](https://tisch.nyu.edu/itp)**.

There are also a number of ways to learn Digital Humanities without formally enrolling in coursework. The **[NYU Library offers workshops](https://nyu.libcal.com/)** including Data Services, Digital Scholarship, and High Performance Computing.
