abstract: "“Underwriting Risk in the 18th century” provides the first systematic analysis
  of the application of probabilistic mathematics to the trade in enslaved Africans
  during the designated period. It will provide foundational research for an exploration
  of the relationship between the marine insurance industry and the trans-Atlantic
  trade in human beings across more than one hundred years. This research is comprised
  of three activities that will produce two outcomes. The first activity involves
  systematically consulting the remaining records of every known Lloyd’s of London-affiliated
  underwriter in order to ascertain the extant information on the insurance of slave
  voyages through London’s largest insurance market. The second activity entails a
  reevaluation of insurance-focused archival collections for records pertaining to
  the trade of enslaved Africans as well as a reevaluation of slavery-focused archival
  collections for records pertaining to insurance. The third activity we intend to
  engage in is preliminary archival research on the relationship between the slave
  trade and insurance in Spain, Holland, and Switzerland as well as the insurance
  of slave-produced goods returning to Europe. The first result of our funded activities
  will be the foundational research that I use to comprehensively analyze how monetary
  value was produced and inscribed during the trans-Atlantic slave trade. The second
  result of our funded activities will be a vastly expanded data set to include in
  the digital ledger I founded and direct, Treasury of Weary Souls, which currently
  provides interactive, public access to all known insurance policies that underwrote
  enslaved persons as property on the plantations of the antebellum American South."
