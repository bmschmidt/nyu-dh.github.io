abstract: 'The "Holding Hiring Algorithms Accountable and Creating New Tools for Humanistic
  Research" project is led by Prof. Hilke Schellmann (Journalism) and Dr. Mona Sloane
  (Tandon). It focuses on artificial intelligence (AI) and hiring. Thanks to AI, hiring
  is undergoing a quiet, yet earth-shaking revolution. Many Fortune 500 companies
  employ AI-based solutions to weed through the millions of job applications the companies
  receive every year. The problem\: many companies don\''t want to reveal what technology
  they are using and vendors don\''t want to reveal what\''s in the black box, despite
  evidence that some automated decision making systems make biased and/or arbitrary
  decisions. This project combines methods of investigative journalism, sociology,
  and data science to develop a new socio-technical tool for critically investigating
  and auditing AI systems used in hiring.'
