The shared community at DH at NYU is created by a number of different organizations working in tandem.



- **Researchers** in DH at the graduate and faculty level create innovative scholarship and new forms of scholarship. To see some of the many people who have been working in this area, look through some of our [seed grants](#TO-DO) and [other projects](#TO-DO).
- **Teaching** in DH happens through the [affiliated faculty in the Program in Digital Humanities and Social Sciences](#TO-DO) and the [summer internship program](#TO-DO).
- **Expert consultations and support** is contributed from a variety of units.
- **Administrative Support** is volunteered by people in the above categories, and through the NYU Center for the Humanities.
- **Planning and initiatives** happens through the [DH Initiative Technology Committee](#TO-DO) run through, and through the [Digital Humanities Faculty Steering Committee](exec-committee/).
