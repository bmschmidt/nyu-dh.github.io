<p>The Graduate School in Arts and Sciences at NYU offers joint degrees in which a student can receive 
an official degree in Digital Humanities while double-counting most of their course work.</p>

<p>Students must take the three <a href="./core-dh-courses">required digital humanities courses</a>, two 
of which can be double-counted against their degree requirements, as well as two electives. In most cases,
this means that students will take two additional courses above the requirements for the MA or PhD.</p>

<p>The following programs currently offer a dual degree.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Comparative Literature PhD</li>
  <li>East Asian Studies PhD</li>
  <li>English MA</li>
  <li>English PhD</li>
